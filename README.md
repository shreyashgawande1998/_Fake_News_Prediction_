# _Fake_News_Prediction_
# Project Overview
Created an end to end project built with machine learning,that can predict whether a news is fake or real.
# Python Packages Used
Data Manipulation:Packages used for handling and importing dataset such as pandas, numpy and others.Machine Learning: This includes packages that were used to generate the ML model such as ,nltk,re,scikit-learn,etc.
# Source Data
I have downloaded these dataset from kaggle.
# Work Flow
:-Data collection :-Data Preprocessing :-Train-Test_Split :-Model Training :-Model Evaluation.
# Results
I got 97% accuracy using logistic regression model,so i have successfully build the predictive system which will predict whether a news is fake or real.
